# Time-series-analysis

Node selection for LSTM models is typically arbitrary, with values such as 128 or 256 being commonly used. However, if we can develop a heuristic approach for selecting nodes, we can avoid random node assignment for model parameter selection. This will lead to a more efficient utilization of resources and the creation of better models.

I proposed a metric approach to node selection, which is second to none. By leveraging carefully crafted metrics, I analyze and evaluate its performance on a diverse range of two real datasets using various LSTM architectures.

Unfortunately, we had to abandon the project as the experimental results did not support the proposed metric. 

For the time being, for more details, please check the link for a full report of the analysis.
